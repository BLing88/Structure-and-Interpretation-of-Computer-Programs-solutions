The answer list is first in the reverse order because the answer list is being created from the end of the list.

Switching the arguments to cons does not fix this bug because now a proper list is not being constructed. 
Instead of each item being in the car of each pair, and the reference to the next pair in the cdr, it is 
the other way around.
